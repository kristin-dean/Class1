  <h2>Chapter 3 - The Truth Continuum</h2>
    <p>In Chapter 3, Cairo discusses the concept of truthfulness in visualizations. Since visualizations are models, it is very 
      difficult for any one visualization to be 100% truthful and accurate. Therefore, both viewers and creators contribute to 
      errors in “truth” of data visualizations. Cairo discusses three mind bugs that our human minds create when looking at data 
      charts and graphs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Patternicity Bug – Finding patterns in data because we are looking for them, even if those patterns don’t actually exist.</li>
<li>Storytelling Bug – Creating a story to explain and connect the patterns our minds detect.</li>
<li>Confirmation Bug – Interpreting all data as confirming our explanation, even if it actually contradicts it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cairo then moves on to talk about the mistakes made on the creation side of visualizations. He discusses a misleading 
  journalism headline and then suggests that before we create or publish visualizations, we must stop and think. This will 
  reduce confirmation bias / tunnel vision and also motivate to increase the depth and breadth with which we are viewing 
  patterns and facts. Cairo concludes saying that a <i>perfect</i> model is unrealistic but through good practices, viewing, 
  and application, we can certainly create visualizations that are extremely effective.</p>

  <h2>Lying to Tell the Truth</h2>
    <p>I cannot think of a specific time I have lied to tell the truth better, but more of a general scenario. In the case
      \that I am telling a story or recounting some event to someone, I might downplay irrelevant information in order to 
      emphasize the important parts of the story. By doing this, the person I am talking to is not distracted by extraneous 
      information and can focus on the main part of the story. Exlcuding irrelevant information increases the truth of the 
      point I am trying to get across by making that point the priority.</p>
