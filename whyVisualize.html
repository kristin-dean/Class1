    <p>Responses to Cairo Chapter 5 Reading:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Why is visualization effective? – Visualization makes data mean something to people. It takes a table or list of 
        qualitative or quantitative data and brings it to life for viewers. Simply seeing numbers in a chart means next to nothing
        to a person because they can’t see what it means or why it is important. Through visualizations, we are able to use depth, 
        color, interaction, comparison, etc. to show people why they need or want to see this data. A barchart or lollipop chart
        with color and dimension draws the viewer’s eye to examine the chart and figure out what it means and what they are supposed 
        to gather from it. Visualization pulls people in and doesn’t allow them to disregard information because it simply looks boring, 
        as a table of data might. </li>
      <br />
      <li>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks? – Some of the most effective ways to encode 
        perceptual tasks can be found in the scale provided on page 128 of the textbook. Those that enable accurate estimates include
        position along common scales or position along identical, nonaligned scales, length visualizations, data maps, and those 
        portraying angle/area data. One of the most ineffective ways to portray data, however, is the radar chart and Cairo advises 
        against using them due to their lack of productivity. One thing to remember however is that every visualization is different 
        and the kind of chart you want to use depends on your data and what you’re trying to achieve. For example, sometimes it is 
        best to disregard 0-baselines if using higher value baselines makes the data easier to read and interpret.</li>
      <br />
      <li>What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization? – Cairo proposes the idea of 
        0-baselines (as mentioned before) as well as the concept of whether the data itself is the most important part to consider 
        or if it is the difference between datasets that you wish to portray. He goes on to talk about the organization of datasets, 
        such as the influence of advertising methods across age groups: the creator should consider whether the graph is meant to show 
        the most-to-least-effective methods for each age group or if the graph is meant to show the change in efficiency of advertisement 
        methods as a person ages. Every visualization is unique and requires its own thought-process of what would be best, and Cairo 
        stresses that throughout Chapter 5.</li>
