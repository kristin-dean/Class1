  <h1>Finding Datasets</h1>
  <h3><a href="breast-cancer-project.csv">Prevalance by Age and Race</a></h3>
    <p>This dataset is the same dataset I provided the first time we went searching for data about our cause. This specific 
      CSV holds data about breast cancer prevalence in females, sorted by race and age. This data was collected by the Center for 
      Disease Control, the CDC. With this data, I would want to separate the races and form lines connecting the prevalence levels
      at each age. This way, someone viewing my visualization could see what race/age pairings are the most likely to be diagnosed 
      according to the jumps between age markers.</p>
  <h3><a href="breast-cancer-ohio.csv">Prevelance in Ohio Specifically</a></h3>
    <p>This dataset is a little more specific than the one above. This one is about Ohio breast cancer prevalence levels. What I picture 
        using this data for is a more interactive aspect of a data visualization. So I could show the entire United States and then
        when a user clicks a specific state, data gets more specific depending on what the user clicks on and what kind of data they 
        want to see more of.</p>
  <br />
  <p>Overall, the goal of these kind of data visualizations is to show women who use these how at risk they are, depending on their 
        age and race. This is done with the hope more women will get tested when they're younger. This drive / cause is motivated 
        by my mom, because she did not get tested until her friend saw a chart and told her she should get tested as soon as possible, 
        and that might have saved her life.</p>
