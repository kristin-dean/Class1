<p>In the code shown above, the reduce() function is used to find the mean of the distribution 
  given to us. In the script tag, you can see the array with the list of numbers given. 
  The list is set to equal a variable named <i>numbers</i>. From here, a function is defined
  called <i>getSum</i> that gets a total of all the numbers in an array and returns this total
  number. Next, a function called <i>myFunction</i> is defined and this is where the real 
  calculations take place. The first line of the function changes the text inside a HTML paragraph
  to display the sum calculated in <i>getSum</i>. This line uses the reduce() function to grab a
  single value from the provided function: the total.<p>
  <p>***This line should have been deleted because it is overwritten later and the reduce function is used again anyway.***</p>
  <p>From here, the example code takes this total and sets it to the variable <i>y</i>. 
    This function is then divided by 20 (the total number of numbers in the array) to find the mean. 
    Finally, the mean is displayed to the HTML paragraph with the id "demo" so the user can see it.</p>
