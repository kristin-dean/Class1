<p>One example of a great visualization that I found was the chart above, which portrays the reach of the polio virus in 
  the United States, before and after the polio vaccine was introduced to the US. I would say this visual has 
  all five of the “Qualities of Great Visualizations” discussed in the reading. </p>
<ol>
<li>It is <b>truthful.</b> – The chart uses valid statistics from over four decades regarding who was infected with the virus. 
  It focuses on the years where the virus was most prominent (1928-1970), but does not exclude any information to prove 
  its point. I think this quality could be improved if all 50 states were represented in the chart, but I would guess they 
  are missing due to lack of hospital records or inadequate data to include states like Ohio or Kentucky. </li>
<li>It is <b>functional.</b> – The chart portrays the data for us to interpret easily and correctly. While it is a little hard to 
  differentiate specific state lines, the graph isn’t about specific states. It is touching on how polio impacted people 
  all across the country and how it widespread the disease was entering the 1950s. The main point of this visualization 
  is to express how much of an impact the polio vaccine had on the containment of the disease and the clear black line down
  the middle of the year 1955, makes it easy for the audience to tell the difference between <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> 
  the vaccine’s introduction. Following 1955, we can tell how quickly polio phased out of existence due to the power of medicine.</li>
<li>It is <b>beautiful.</b> – A strong suit of this visualization is the color used to portray how many people where infected. The yellow, 
  orange, and red colors used as the disease spread more and more are a sharp contract to the blue and green colors used when 
  the disease was not as widespread in the states. This makes the visual visually appealing and easy to gather the main message 
  of the chart.</li>
<li>It is <b>insightful.</b> – As a person who did not live through this time period, I do not know much about the polio virus besides 
  its debilitating symptoms and that it is no longer present in the US today. This chart, however, explains the widespread fear 
  of the disease in the 1940s and 1950s, and also clearly displays the positive effects of the vaccine for polio. It would be hard 
  to argue with this graph since it is so obviously shown that after the vaccine was introduced, infection levels dropped severely 
  and almost to zero within five years. This chart sparks that “wow” moment as we can be amazed by how quick and life-changing the 
  vaccine was.</li>
<li>It is <b>enlightening.</b> – Finally, this visualization is centered around a controversial topic, but it makes its point and 
  leaves viewers with a clear representation of the positive effects of vaccines. The polio vaccine was introduced at a time 
  when the disease was spreading fast and nearly eradicated the disease in a short period of time and has since kept the virus 
  out of the public fear since the 1960s.</li>
</ol>

<p>While I enjoy this visualization very much and think it represents all five qualities of great visualizations, no visualization 
  is ever perfect. Like I stated earlier, I wish all 50 states could be seen in the chart so we could get a clear view of polio’s 
  effect across the entire nation. There is also no label along the vertical axis besides the state. It might have been cut off in 
  the capture to posting on the website in which I found it, but I just assumed it was in thousands of people in each state who 
  contracted polio. Clarification in this realm would improve the audience’s interpretation greatly. Lastly, I think the chart 
  could have been titled better instead of just a concise “Polio”.</p>
<p>This visualization expands the island of knowledge immensely, providing quality data visualization about polio, its reach in 
  the decades shown, and the effect of its vaccine: information I had not known before, but that now makes me wonder if similar 
  charts exist for other viruses like measles, chicken pox, etc.</p>

<p>There are a few parts of this graph that I have issues with visualization. Right off the bat, the creator of this 
  chart chose to turn the vertical axis of this chart upside down. Most people read graphs with the (0,0) point in the 
  bottom left corner, but this graph is confusing to the audience. At first glance, it looks like there is a peak in gun 
  deaths in Florida around 1998, but in reality, this point on the graph is the lowest number of shootings represented. 
  This confusion causes big concerns with the graph, because the audience either gets the wrong message entirely from the 
  visual or has to work extra hard to understand what the graph is trying to say. Another issue I have with the graph is 
  that it highlights the enaction of the “Stand Your Ground” law but non-Florida residents do not know what this law is and, 
  therefore, miss the point the visual is trying to make about gun laws and gun deaths. These two big issues with the chart 
  could be easily fixed to make the visual more functional, more insightful, and more enlightening. The creator of the visual 
  would need to flip the graph so that lower numbers of gun deaths are closer to the bottom of the graph and higher numbers 
  closer to the top. This would make the data much easier to understand and learn something from. Additionally, the creator 
  should insert some sort of explanation about the “Stand Your Ground” law so we, as the audience, are able to understand if 
  this law should have reduced gun deaths or if it was increased access to guns and is therefore, not surprising that there was 
  a spike in gun deaths following the law.</p>
<p>Besides the major flaws in this visual, there are some good aspects. The use of red in the graph highlights the violent 
  (and bloody) nature of gun deaths and might cause a sense of fear in the audience regarding firearms. The chart also chooses 
  a very pertinent and controversial topic to discuss and provide data on, in hopes of sparking insight in an audience or 
  portraying some sort of message to grasp. The issues with the chart hinder the communication of this message and should be fixed.</p>
