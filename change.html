  <h2>Techniques to Highlight Change in Visualizations</h2>
  <p>One visualization strategy that Cairo talked about in chapter 8 was the <b>seasonal subseries chart</b>. This kind of chart divides 
    a time period into smaller bin of data such as weeks, months, years, etc. and examines data for that specific section of a time
    period. In the book, Cairo talked about the seasonality of tourism in Spain and how that impacts the amount of Spaniards enrolled
    in Social Security benefits. He then divided the data into monthly categories and examined each month in comparison to an overall
    mean. Seasonal subseries charts are often used in climate analytics and I was able to find the following graph that accesses the 
    difference of the average CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations for each month and the overall average CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations.
    It is easy to see that carbon dioxide concentrations jump far above the average amount in April, May, and June but drop below 
    the average in fall months such as September and October. </p>

  <p>Another technique Cairo discusses is the <b>logarithmic scale visualizations</b>. This type of visualization is helpful in 
    displaying change rate in data, especially rapid change rates. The example in the book was the growth of bacterial over a 
    50-day time period. Without a logarithmic scale, it was quite difficult to see the rate of change since it grew so quickly 
    and exponentially. With a log<sub>10</sub> scale, Cairo was able to manipulate the data and make it easier to see the constant 
    growth of the bacteria over time. One very common use of a logarithmic scale visualization that I did not realize fell into 
    this category is the Richter scale. This scale measures the strength of earthquakes in the sense that an earthquake that measures 
    1.0 stronger than a difference earthquake is actually 10<sup>1</sup> stronger. The log<sub>10</sub> scale of the chart below 
    allows an audience to see the difference in magnitude and how this correlates to strength.</p>

  <p>Lastly, Cairo explains the Simpson Paradox and the importance of <b>disaggregating data</b>. If massive amounts of data are 
    grouped together, this could lead to inaccurate generalizations being made about the data as a whole. Therefore, by breaking 
    datasets into smaller, more specific groupings the error of assumption can be minimalized, and the viewer can see a more specific 
    display of data. In the example below, if the chart creator were to only provide the “Total” bar, this could be deceiving since 
    the total percentage of children in poverty is only 6%, but by separating the data into ethnicity and race, we can see the high 
    levels of American Indian and African American children experiencing poverty versus the relatively small percentage of white 
    children in poverty. The difference in population size is most likely the cause for this skewed total percentage, so it is 
    important to examine more specific data and see the contrasts that present themselves there.</p>
