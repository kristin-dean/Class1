<title>SQL Inner JOIN</title>

<body>
<p>The inner JOIN keyword in SQL is a specific way of merging tables in an SQL database. The syntax for calling the inner 
JOIN method is below:</p>

<pre>
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
</pre>

<p>Walking through each line of the sample code above will allow us to understand inner JOIN better. The first line 
<pre> SELECT column_name(s) </pre> shows what we want the database to feed back to us after the rest of the code executes. 
The code then joins specifies the table we want to look at which is in this case “table 1”. The third line is where the inner 
JOIN keyword comes into play.</p>
