  Top 50 Most Valuable Sports Franchises</a></li>
</ul>
  
<p>The animation linked above graphs (in a scatterplot format) Forbes' ranking of the Top 50 Most Valuable Sports Franchises based on
  number of champtionships won and years in operation. This visualization incorperates franchises from a handful of sports and teams
  across the world so the data incorporated in very widespread.</p>
 
<p>Some of the features I see in this visualization that remind me of methods from our reading are as follow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>.on() - This method waits for the click of a mouse to tell the graph how to interact with the user's inputs. When the user 
      clicks speciic sports at the top of the chart, the data being plotted changes depending on what sport is selected. If the 
      user clicks the "Baseball" text, the dateset being displayed changes to just the baseball teams ranked in the top 50 most 
      valuable. This happens for every sport and the "View All" option; a new dataset is bound to the graph and the scatterplot is 
      updated accordingly.</li>
    <li>.transition() - This method makes the change between datasets very smooth, so when the user clicks a new sport to view,
      the old plot points don't just disappear, they fade and the new data fades in. This feature makes the visualization very pleasing
      and nicer to look at. The built-in function that the grpah looks similar to is d3.easeCircleIn</li>
    <li>.duration() - This method slows down the transition applied to the visualization by a specified time. In the transition used on 
      the graph so that the user can see the old data fade away and the new data fade in. This makes the plotting very easy to read and 
      to see the difference between sports as the graph updates.</li>
    <li>.append("title") - In the visualization provided, the title added is much more detailed than the example from the textbook, 
    but the concept is the same. When the mouse is hovering over a specific franchise, a box appears with information about that 
    specific team, such as the number of championships won, years active, and its ranking in the top 50. This information box
    would require a lot of additional code to produce it, especially the formatting but it resembles the .append("title") method 
    as the basic level.</li>
    
  </ul>
