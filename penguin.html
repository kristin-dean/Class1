<p>Histogram for Quiz Grades for Bookworm Penguin</p>
<p>The histogram above represents the quiz grades of the Bookworm Penguin. I created this histogram using Google Sheets. I transferred
  the relevant data (all quiz grades) into a Google Sheet, highlighted the data, and inserted a chart. This chart, however, was a line chart,
  not exactly what I wanted. Therefore, I selected the graph and changed the "Chart Type" to Histogram, changed the "Bin Size" to 1, added 
  a vertical axis label to the chart and called it "Frequency".</p>
