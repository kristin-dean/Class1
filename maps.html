  <h2>Maps as Data Visualizations</h2>
  <p>The question: What are two mistakes that people often make when creating visualizations with maps?</p>
  <p>The answer:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Proportionality. One big issue with using symbols on maps is keeping proportionality true. If a software program or tool 
    attempts to scale a circle up by 200% (like in Figure 10.13 on page 274), it will actually scale up by 400%. This mistake in 
    the software can then lead to misleading visualizations that portray inaccurate information to an audience. This is something 
    that needs to be verified and likely done by hand before publishing a visualization.</li>
    <li><b>Software defaults.</b> Cairo discusses on pages 280-282 the dangers of trusting software defaults. Letting a software choose 
    color schemes or ranges for maps can lead to misleading or hard to read diagrams such as those found on page 281. Software defaults
    in this scenario chose scales for the legend that made it seem like over half of the US population was of Hispanic descent, which is 
    not accurate. Although it might require more work from time to time, in cases such as these, it is better to manually set those
    scales so that the visualization is showing data accurately.</li>
  </ol>
