  <h2>Uses of Force Diagrams</h2>
  <br />
  <h4>Evolutionary Progressions</h4>
  <p>One example of a dataset where a force diagram might be application is a phylogenetic tree. This diagram represents evolutionary 
    relationships among organisms. Therefore, the nodes of the dataset would be the names of species that will be included in the 
    visualization and the edges show the relationships between the species. An example is included below. As you can see, some 
    species such as eurybacteria connect to multiple other nodes while others like chlorobacteria connect to just one other node. 
    Using a force diagram with this type of data allows the user to see how it is impossible to get to one species without its 
    evolutionary predecessors since the edges keep them connected at all times. </p>
