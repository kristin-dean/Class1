  <h2>Uses of Force Diagrams</h2>
  <h4>Evolutionary Progressions</h4>
  <p>One example of a dataset where a force diagram might be application is a phylogenetic tree. This diagram represents evolutionary 
    relationships among organisms. Therefore, the nodes of the dataset would be the names of species that will be included in the 
    visualization and the edges show the relationships between the species. An example is included below. As you can see, some 
    species such as eurybacteria connect to multiple other nodes while others like chlorobacteria connect to just one other node. 
    Using a force diagram with this type of data allows the user to see how it is impossible to get to one species without its 
    evolutionary predecessors since the edges keep them connected at all times. </p>

  <h4>Trading Networks</h4>
  <p>Another type of data that I think would be well-represented in a force diagram are trading networks. Nations are often 
    engaged in trade with many other nations, so with each country receiving its own node, edges would represent established 
    trade relations across the world. A force diagram in this instance also does a great job of shows which nations are the 
    biggest powers in international trade. In the diagram below, we can see the United States of America has many arrows 
    connecting to its node, with Brazil, France, and Argentina also displaying numerous trade partners.</p>

  <h4>Food Chains</h4>
  <p>My last example of data to use with force diagrams is food chains. I am not sure if arrows can be added to force diagram 
    edges in d3, but if they could, an arrow on the target end of an edge would portray food chain behaviors extremely well. 
    As with the evolutionary relationships, food chain relationships connect every species to another in one way or another. 
    The example below is a bit odd as we do not often think of eating animals like Arctic wolves and polar bears, but animals 
    like caribou and lemmings very much rely on the consumption of grasses and that is shown at the bottom of this food chain 
    diagram.</p>
