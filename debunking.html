  <h2>Debunking Breast Cancer Myths</h2>
  <br />
  <h3>The Myth: Breast cancer is a women's disease.</h3>
  <p>The Truth: Often times the amount of men diagnosed with breast cancer is under-reported or 
    overlooked due to the significantly higher number of women diagnosed each year, but
    uncontrolled cell growth of mutated cells in breast tissue can occur in both men and 
    women. The National Breast Cancer Foundation Inc. reports that almost 3000 men will be 
    diagnosed and over 400 men will die from breast cancer every year. Indeed, men and women
    should both perform self-checks and see a doctor if he/she detects a lump.</p>
